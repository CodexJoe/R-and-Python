This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.


#Reading The CSV file
HRM <- read.csv("C:/Users/HP/Desktop/RProgram/codex/HR_comma_sep.csv")

#Getting Overview of the Data
head(HRM)

#Getting the Summary of the Data
summary(HRM)

#descriptive statistics
print(min(HRM$last_evaluation))
print(max(HRM$last_evaluation))
print(mean(HRM$last_evaluation))
print(median(HRM$last_evaluation))
print(var(HRM$last_evaluation))
print(sd(HRM$last_evaluation))




Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
